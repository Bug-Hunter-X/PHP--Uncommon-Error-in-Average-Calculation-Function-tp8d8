# PHP: Uncommon Error in Average Calculation Function

This repository demonstrates a subtle error in a PHP function designed to calculate the average of numbers in an array. The function handles empty arrays correctly but lacks robust error handling for non-numeric input. 
The `bug.php` file contains the original, flawed function.  The `bugSolution.php` file offers an improved version.
